- Source visual truth: `/var/folders/lx/6r9vdddj2k98rm7xg5g8hb7h0000gn/T/codex-clipboard-61afe6d3-5065-4dbe-814e-4f9e5d1c5a97.png`

- Implementation screenshot: `/Users/huangshaoshuai/Documents/New project/work-globe/openwork-qa-desktop.png`
- Selected-country screenshot: `/tmp/openwork-country-selected-200.png`
- High-latitude geometry screenshot: `/tmp/openwork-country-edges-075.png`
- Side-by-side comparison: `/tmp/openwork-palette-comparison.png`
- Viewport: source 1487 × 1058; implementation captured at 1488 × 1058 and normalized by cropping one right-edge pixel.
- State: desktop explore view, search keyword empty, all city-precision jobs visible; country selection、country-to-country switching and country-to-job switching also verified.

## Full-view comparison evidence

- The reference and implementation were placed in one side-by-side comparison image before judging the result.
- Both now use the same light, low-saturation country family: dusty blush, pale apricot, powder blue, sage, warm stone, and lavender gray.
- White country boundaries remain clear against every fill, including small European countries and dense African borders.
- The globe sphere retains its blue-gray gradient and the country plates remain visually separated from it by the existing subtle side shadow.
- No focused crop was needed: country fills occupy most of both full-view captures and are large enough to compare color, flatness, borders, and separation directly.

## Required fidelity surfaces

- Fonts and typography: unchanged and outside this palette-only request; no new wrapping or hierarchy regression is visible.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: unchanged; header, globe, search dock, and persistent controls keep their existing positions.
- Colors and visual tokens: the former mid-tone Morandi palette was replaced with ten sampled/inferred light tokens. All tokens have an average RGB channel value of at least 205 and a channel spread no greater than 40, while the six hue groups still prevent adjacent countries from sharing the same apparent family.
- Selected-country state: the active country keeps the same lightness and increases only HSL saturation by 200% (three times the original, capped at 100%). Selecting a different country restores the previous country before applying the same treatment to the new one; clearing the map restores every country.
- Image quality and asset fidelity: no new raster or generated assets were required. Country caps remain clean solid fills with no texture, noise, or compression artifacts.
- Copy and content: unchanged.

## Comparison history

1. Initial finding — P1: the implementation screenshot at `/tmp/openwork-palette-before.png` showed country fills one full lightness tier darker than the reference, especially salmon, ochre, green, and lavender regions.
2. Fix: replaced the ten country tokens with lighter reference-derived values while preserving the existing adjacency graph, hue grouping, white strokes, raised cap altitude, and globe material.
3. Cache correction: versioned the dynamic `explore.js` import so an already-open browser cannot retain the previous palette after a normal reload.
4. Post-fix evidence: `/Users/huangshaoshuai/Documents/New project/work-globe/openwork-qa-desktop.png` and `/tmp/openwork-palette-comparison.png` show the corrected light palette. Browser console check returned no errors.
5. Interaction refinement: browser verification captured the selected-country treatment and no console errors. The regression test switches between two countries and confirms the former country returns to its exact base color while the new country receives the 200% saturation increase.
6. Geometry refinement: polygon cap curvature resolution was reduced from Globe.gl's 5-degree default to 0.75 degrees. The denser spherical tessellation prevents the long triangular facets visible around large and high-latitude countries from cutting through the globe or neighboring boundaries.

## Findings

- No remaining P0, P1, or P2 issues in the requested country-color scope.
- [P3] The implementation background is warmer than the blue-tinted reference canvas, but it was intentionally left unchanged because the request targets country fills only.

## Automated evidence

- 177 country polygons load successfully.
- More than 100 shared-border neighbor pairs remain detected and every pair avoids the same palette index.
- The Americas still use at least eight palette entries.
- The new test asserts at least eight distinct light country colors and prevents a return to darker or highly saturated fills.
- Country selection tests assert a 200% saturation increase (capped at 100%) with unchanged lightness, single-selection restoration when switching countries, and full restoration when clearing the map.
- Country geometry tests assert cap curvature tessellation at 0.75 degrees or finer, in addition to closed country rings.
- Existing country borders, raised plates, marker scaling, aggregation, filtering, and interaction tests pass.

final result: passed
